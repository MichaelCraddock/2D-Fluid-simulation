Hello this is a guide to how to use my project.

To open the project go to 2D Fluid simulator > Assets and open up the scene called 2D fluid scene. once the scene has loaded up you should 
be able to just run the scene. To spawn in items to interact with the water use the left and right mouse buttons.

A youtube link showcasing this project can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHbjD8teXSY&feature=youtu.be

This was a solo project.
